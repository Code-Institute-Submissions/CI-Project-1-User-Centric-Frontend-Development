# CI: Project-1 User Centric Frontend Development - Trinity College Scholarship Application

I have decided to build a website for my application for a scholarship from Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. As I have recently got in to a Masters programme at TCD. I have found out that there was an opporunity to recieve a partial scholarship and decided to build a website as my application.  

My goal with the website is very simple, first have a look at the rich history of Trinity College, then showcase my best side and show them why I am a perfect candidate for this scholarship. Including my own personal story, some of my achievements and why I will be a good amabsassador for them in the future. This website will serve a very niche purpose and I will keep this in mind as designing it. 
 
## 1.UX

### Project Goals 

The primary goal is to provide a clean, intuitive and userfriendly website for the admission team at Trinity College, to showcase my best side and help me to potentially get the partial scholarship. The website will only be viewed by the admission team as a supporting project to my main submisson. 

The secondary goal is to learn how to make stunning and beautiful websites that elicit a postive emotion in the end user. I want it to be educational about TCD's rich history and also interesting and iteractive to read my story. 

### User Goals 
- A brochure website to view an extra submission by a student who wants to try and recieve a scholarship. 
- A vissualy applealing and well functioning website. 
- An ability to download the students CV, and contact them. 
- Easy to navigate, with an intuitive feeling on the website. 


### Developer Goals 

- A well thought out and easy to navigate brochure website with some stunning css and html. 
- Some good basic functionality such as the download of CV, contact button, and gallery.
- A project I am excited to learn from and make it part of my portfolio.


### User Stories  

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user that is part of the addmissions team at Trinity College, I want:

1. To see that sufficient effort went into this project and there are no spelling mistakes, so that I can be sure that this student deserves to recieve the partial scholarship.
2. To see good use of colours on the website that are also alligned with Trinity College's brand colours, so that I can easier relate to the website and understand it's purpose easily. 
3. To be able to navigate the website easily and intuitively, so that I do not get a negative emotion viewing the website. 
4. To be able click on each link and it's content either neatly opens on the website I am viewing or on a seperate tab if it's from a diffent source, so that I have a pleasant user experience that has a natrual flow to it.
5. To be able to easily understand that an action I have done was perfomed or is about to be performed, for example if I am about to click on a button the clour of this button changes, so that I can understand when I am about to click on a new action. 
6. To have no doubt that this website was carefully crafted and nothing told was an exageration or untruth, so that I can be sure that I can trust this individual. 
7. To see easy to understand visual icons I am familiar with like the social media tags we all know or the download button, so that I can easily use visual ques to navigate the website. 

### Design Choices 

The website was designed so that it clearly shows the admission team at Trinity College all of the information that they need to know about the student who wishes to recieve the partial scholarship. The website needs to be easy to navigate and intuitive to these users. 

#### Fonts 

#### Icons 

#### Colours 

#### Styling 

#### Backgrounds 

#### Card Imagery 

#### Video Files 

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Wireframes 
 
 This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## 2.Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## 3.Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## 4.Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Bugs Discovered 

#### Solved Bugs 

1. 



2. 

## 5.Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
